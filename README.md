# my-research Repository
To ensure transparency and reproducibility, all code, simulation scripts, and datasets used in this study will be made publicly available. The simulation topologies (Silverlake City, UrbanHub400, and Metropolis) were created using the Cooja simulator in the Contiki OS environment and can be reproduced using the provided configuration files. Additionally, the complete source code for data preprocessing, model training (including base learners and the TRHP stacking ensemble), and evaluation metrics is written in Python and organized within Jupyter Notebooks.
The following resources will be hosted on a public GitHub repository:
     i) Contiki/Cooja simulation configuration files for all three topologies, 
     ii) Raw and preprocessed datasets with trusted/untrusted path labels,
    iii) Python scripts for preprocessing, model training, prediction, and visualization,
     iv) Experiment logs and trained model artifacts for TRHP and its base learners, and
     v) A README file with step-by-step instructions for setup and execution. 
We encourage the research community to reuse, adapt, and extend our framework for further investigation in IoT security and trusted routing prediction.
